## Project Description
This project is a full-stack application built with JavaScript, using Node.js and MongoDB for the backend, and React or Angular for the frontend. The application provides a RESTful API with JWT-based authentication and includes an administrative dashboard for managing users.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate an understanding of full-stack development, from idea conception to a fully functional application, with a focus on security and user experience.

## Features
- **User Registration and Login:** Users can create an account and log in with JWT-based authentication.
- **Search Functionality:** Users can search within the application (specify what they are searching for, e.g., products, articles, etc.).
- **Admin Panel:** Admin users can log in to manage users (CRUD operations).
- **Responsive Design:** The application works well on all devices and screen sizes.
- **PWA Support:** The application can be used offline.

## API Documentation
The API documentation is available via [Postman](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/34481210/2sAXxY2TTq) and covers all essential endpoints.

## User Study and UX
To design the user experience, a user study was conducted with at least 5 participants who provided feedback on their needs and expectations. Based on these results, personas and user stories were created, which were used to generate lo-fi wireframes and a sitemap.

## Tech Stack
This project uses the following technologies and libraries:

### Backend:
- **Node.js** with **Express** framework
- **MongoDB** as the database
- **JWT** for authentication
- **Mongoose** for database modeling

### Frontend:
- **React** for the user interface
- **CSS** or **Tailwind** for styling (following the [Airbnb CSS style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/css))
